# BMI Calculator

Self completed companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp. An appplication that based on the user’s weight and height will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. 

## Goal of the application

The goal of this tutorial is to learn more about Optionals, solidify your understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes. We’ll compare objects created from classes with instances of Structs that we learnt about earlier. 


## Learned About

* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.
